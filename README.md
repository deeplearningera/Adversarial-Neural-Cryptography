# Adversarial-Neural-Cryptography
The idea of the project is to implement the neural networks described in Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography.  Three Neural Networks(Alice, Bob and Eve) were used to study whether there can be secure communication between Alice and Bob, in the presence of third party that is eve.
